\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{01/17/2018 Concept of the game 2 \& Book of Specifications}
\section*{Wednesday, January 17, 2018}
	\subsubsection*{Done :}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] At home each one of us found some references (game examples / schemes) to explain how he saw a certain part of the project.
        \item[-] As the book of Specification was already done, we just had to merge our ideas and our own more detailed concept of the game.
        \item[-] Then, we did the tasks division and planning for the book of specification.
      \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection*{To do for the next time :}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] End the book of Specifications for Friday 19.
        \item[-] Start using Unity
        \item[-] Go at the GConf of Friday for a better understanding of Unity.
      \end{itemize}
    
	\subsubsection*{Remarks :}
		\paragraph{} Finally, the redaction of this Book of Specification took more than planned. It was finished on time but it wasn't that easy... The incomprehension and issues with LaTex language take a non-negligible place on this work.

	\subsubsection*{Remarks :}
		\paragraph{} There will be some work this week-end (Maths TD-test / MCQ / Programming TP). so it will be normal for us to be less engage in the multi-player implementation.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{01/31/2018 Starting the Project}
\section*{Wednesday, January 31, 2018}
	\subsubsection*{Done :}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] What has been done at home :
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item[-] First implementation of player's movements (by Ziane)
        	\item[-] Some research on Networking / Multi-player
      	\end{itemize}
        \item[-] Here as a group we made a point on what has been done or not
        \item[-] Then we pointed out the things to do for the next week
      \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection*{To do for the next time :}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] Start thinking about mechanics \& object/obstacles of the game (creation of the walls, possibles buttons, and so on) the aim of that is to have a first vision of what could be a map. With this done we would also be able to start the creation of the map, collisions, colors codes, and so on.
        \item[-] Ziane will do a quick Menu/Pause interface
        \item[-] Keep searching informations about Networking \& Multi-player
        \item[-] If we really have the time start thinking about the website.
      \end{itemize}
    
	\subsubsection*{Remarks :}
		\paragraph{} This meeting was really short, as predicted, we didn't have much time to work the project last week-end so there weren't much things to say. But the tasks division was made for the next time which is really good. Hoping we will have more time to work on it this week.
